    <h2><center>Black Hole</center></h2>
    
    <div class="intro">
    A black hole is an extremely dense region of space whose gravitational pull is so intense that nothing—not even light—can escape. 
    They form when massive stars collapse under gravity, leaving a singularity (a point of infinite density) surrounded by an event horizon, 
    the "point of no return".
    </div>
    
    <div class="key_property">
    <h4>Key Properties</h4>
    <p>
    <b>Event Horizon & Singularity:</b> The event horizon marks where escape velocity equals the speed of light. 
    Inside this boundary, all paths lead inward to the singularity, where physics breaks down 
    </p>
    <b>Types:</b>
    <br/>
    <b>Stellar‑mass:</b> A few to tens of solar masses, formed by collapsing stars.
    <br/>
    <b>Supermassive:</b> Millions to billions of solar masses.
    <br/>
    <b>Intermediate:</b> Hundreds to thousands of solar masses; their origins remain under study 

    <p>
    <b>Spaghettification:</b> Extreme tidal forces stretch and compress objects entering a black hole—stretching them like spaghetti 
    when approaching the event horizon 
    </p>
    <b>Hawking Radiation:</b> A theoretical quantum effect where black holes gradually lose mass via radiation—observable only over timescales 
    far exceeding the universe's age for large black holes

    <div class="Discoveries">
    <h4>Recent Discoveries & Insights</h4>
    <strong>Event Horizon Telescope (EHT):</strong>
    <p>
    2025 EHT Update: Astronomers identified why M87’s ring-shaped shadow is not a perfect circle—tracing distortions to plasma turbulence 
    and the black hole’s spin orientation 


    AI-Enhanced Imaging: Machine learning has enabled refined reconstructions of Sagittarius A*, revealing that it rotates near maximum spin 
    and points toward Earth—challenging earlier moderately fast rotation estimates.
    </p>
    Tidal Disruption Events (TDEs): In early 2025, Hubble tracked a wandering black hole ripping apart a star outside its galaxy’s core, 
    offering new glimpses into black hole feeding behavior.

    <h5>Why It Matters</h5>
    <p>
    Testing Gravity & Quantum Physics: Black holes are cosmic laboratories where gravity, relativity, and quantum effects converge—placing l
    imits on fundamental physics theories.
    </p>
    <p>
    Galaxy Evolution: Supermassive black holes influence the evolution of galaxies, regulating star formation via jets and energetic outflows.
    </p>
    <p>
    Gravitational Wave Sources: Mergers of stellar- and supermassive black holes, detected as gravitational waves, provide insight 
    into the universe’s large-scale structure.
    </p>
    <p>
    Pioneering Tools: EHT and AI-driven analysis methods are pushing observational astronomy into new regimes of precision and insight.

    <h4>Summary</h4>
    Black holes represent both fascination and frontiers: invisible objects defined by their shadows, 
    extreme gravitational physics, and quantum mysteries. With cutting-edge imaging, machine learning, and more 
    telescopic data entering the picture, they're transforming our grasp of the universe—and challenging our theories to keep up.
